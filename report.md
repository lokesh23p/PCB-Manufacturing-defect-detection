# Real-Time PCB Defect Detection System using YOLOv8 and Raspberry Pi
## IISc, Edge AI Project

---

## 1. Abstract

This project presents a real-time Printed Circuit Board (PCB) defect detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model deployed on a Raspberry Pi. The system aims to automate defect inspection in PCBs, reducing human error and improving efficiency. A conveyor mechanism simulates an industrial setup, where PCBs move continuously and images are captured using a mobile device via IP Webcam. The captured images are processed using a trained YOLOv8 TFLite model to detect defects such as missing holes, mouse bites, open circuits, shorts, spurs, and spurious copper. The system outputs labeled images indicating defect presence or absence. The solution demonstrates a low-cost, scalable, and efficient approach to real-time industrial inspection.

## 2. Introduction

Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are fundamental components in electronic devices. Ensuring their quality is critical, as defects can lead to device malfunction or failure. Common PCB defects include missing holes, mouse bites, open circuits, shorts, spurs, and spurious copper.

Traditional inspection methods rely on manual visual inspection, which is:

- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Not scalable for large-scale production  

With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, automated inspection systems have become viable. Object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) enable real-time detection with high accuracy, making them suitable for industrial applications.

## 3. Problem Statement

Manual inspection of PCBs is inefficient and unreliable, especially in high-speed production environments. There is a need for an automated system that can:

- Detect multiple types of defects  
- Operate in real-time  
- Provide consistent and accurate results  
- Be cost-effective and deployable on edge devices
